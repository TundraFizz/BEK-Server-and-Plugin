<h1>Do you love FEK?</h1>
<div>
  Want to support me and all the work and time I've poured into FEK?<br/><br/>

  Those that donate will receive "Fish Chips" at the rate of 100 FC per $1 USD donated. Fish Chips can then be turned into custom badges/titles.<br/><br/>
  
  For more information, <a href="http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/NfaEJp19" target="_blank">check out this thread</a>.<br/><br/>
  
  If you would like to donate, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/home" target="_blank">please use PayPal</a> and "Send money to friends and family" to MageLeif@Yahoo.com<br/><br/>
  
  This method bypassess PayPal's hefty donation fee. For example, if you were to donate $1, PayPal would take 33 cents. Be sure you include your Summoner Name and Region in the note!<br/><br/>

  It may take up to 12 hours for me to update FC/badges/titles since it's something I must do manually.<br/><br/>

  FEK donations are optional and I will never require people to pay money in order to enjoy all FEK has to offer.
